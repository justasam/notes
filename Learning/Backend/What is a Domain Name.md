Domains provide human-readable addresses for any web server available on the Internet.
While any Internet-connected computer can be reached through a public IP Address, people have a hard time finding out who is running the server or what service the website offers based on an IP address. To solve this, we use domain names.

#### Domain structure
**TLD** (Top-Level Domain): TLDs tell users the general purpose of service behind the domain name. The most generic TLDs (`.com`, `.org`, `.net`) don't require web services to meet any criteria, but some TLDs enforce stricter policies so it is clearer what their purpose is. For example:
- TLDs containing `.gov` are only allowed to be used by government departments.
- The `.edu` TLD is only for use by education and academic institutions.
**Label** (or a component): labels are what follow the TLD. The label located right before the TLD is also called a *Secondary Level Domain* (SLD). A domain name can have many labels (or components). For any domain you control, you can create "subdomains", e.g. `developer.mozilla.org`, `support.mozilla.org`.

#### Who manages domain names?
Domain names are all managed by domain registries, which delegate the reservation of domain names to registrars.
A domain name registrar provides domain name registrations to the general public. A common misconception is that registrars sell domain names; these domain names are actually owned by registries and can only be leased by users.
